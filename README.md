🌟 Token Smart Contract

This is a simple implementation of a token-like smart contract written in Solidity. It allows the owner of the contract to mint and transfer tokens securely.

✨ Features

👑 Ownership: Only the contract owner (the deployer) can mint or transfer tokens.
🪙 Minting: The owner can create new tokens and assign them to any valid address.
🔄 Transfers: Tokens can be transferred securely from the owner's balance to other addresses.
🔍 Transparency: Token balances can be viewed publicly.
📂 Contract Details
📋 State Variables
owner: Tracks the contract owner, who is assigned during deployment.
balances: A mapping that holds the token balance for each address.
📢 Events
Transfer: Emitted whenever tokens are transferred from the owner to another address.
🚦 Modifiers
onlyOwner: Ensures that certain functions (like mint and transfer) can only be executed by the owner.
🚀 How It Works
Deploy the Contract: The deployer automatically becomes the owner upon deployment.
Mint Tokens: The owner can mint tokens to any valid address.
Transfer Tokens: The owner can transfer tokens to other addresses.
🛠️ Functions Overview
🪙 Minting Tokens
The owner can mint tokens to any valid address.
The recipient’s balance will increase by the minted amount.
🔄 Transferring Tokens
Tokens can be transferred from the owner's balance to another address.
Emits a Transfer event for transparency.
🔑 Key Points to Remember
🚫 Zero Address: Avoid using the zero address (0x0) as a recipient for minting or transferring tokens.
⚠️ Insufficient Balance: Transfers cannot exceed the owner’s available token balance.
👀 Public Balances: Token balances for all addresses can be viewed via the balances mapping.
💡 Usage Examples
Deploy the Contract: Use an Ethereum-compatible wallet and deploy the contract on a blockchain network.
Mint Tokens:
Add tokens to a recipient’s account using the mint function.
Transfer Tokens:
Send tokens from the owner’s balance to another address with the transfer function.
🌐 Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Open the contract in Remix IDE or your preferred Solidity development environment.
Compile and deploy the contract on your desired blockchain network.
Happy Coding! 💻✨
